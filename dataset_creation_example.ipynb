Generate an encryption key:\\n   - Use Fernet to generate a unique encryption key. This key will be used to securely encrypt and decrypt messages sent over the network.\\n\\n3. Create a socket:\\n   - Create a new socket using the socket.socket() function with the socket.AF_INET (IPv4) address family and socket.SOCK_STREAM (TCP) socket type.\\n\\n4. Bind the socket to an address:\\n   - Bind the socket to a specific IP address ('127.0.0.1' is used here, which represents the loopback address, meaning the server will listen for connections on the local host) and a port (8080).\\n\\n5. Listen for incoming connections:\\n   - Call the listen() method on the socket to put it in a listening state, waiting for incoming client connections.\\n\\n6. Accept incoming connections:\\n   - Use the accept() method on the listening socket to accept an incoming client connection, returning a new connected socket object (conn) and the address (addr) of the client.\\n\\n7. Establish a bidirectional communication channel:\\n   - Use a 'with' statement to establish a communication channel with the client. This ensures that the socket is automatically closed when the 'with' block is exited.\\n\\n8. Print a message indicating that a client has connected:\\n   - Print a message to the server console indicating that a client has connected, providing the client's address.\\n\\n9. Continuously receive messages from the client:\\n   - Use a while loop to continuously receive messages from the connected client using the conn.recv() method. Set a buffer size of 1024 bytes for receiving messages.\\n\\n10. Decrypt incoming messages:\\n    - Use the Fernet object (f) created earlier with the encryption key to decrypt the received message (msg) using the decrypt() method.\\n\\n11. Process the decrypted message:\\n    - Perform any necessary processing on the decrypted message, such as printing it to the console.\\n\\n12. Send a reply message to the client:\\n    - Create a reply message (reply), encrypt it using the same Fernet object (f), and send the encrypted message (encrypted_reply) to the client using the conn.sendall() method.\\n\\n13. Repeat the loop until the client disconnects:\\n    - The loop will continue to receive messages from the client, decrypt them, process them, and send replies until the client closes the connection.\"],\n",
